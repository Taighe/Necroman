# Necroman
Unity Project

Necroman is a 2D puzzle platformer that harkens back to the good old days of gaming. The main game mechanic was the ability to create platforms upon death, which is how the player progresses though out the game.
If the player dies when he/she has no soul orbs, then it is game over.

This was made during final year of study at AIE(Acadmey of Interactive Entertainment) as a major project.
